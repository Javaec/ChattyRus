        <li>Sometimes users aren't correctly sorted in the userlist</li>
        <li>Windows: Dragging the upper edge to maximize the window vertically
            doesn't resize the contents of the window. This may be a Java Bug
            that I cannot fix. Workaround: Try double-clicking the upper edge
            instead of dragging it.</li>

    <h3>Errors / Crashes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Using the Calibri font can cause random errors, due to a bug in
            Java.

        <a name="performance">Bad performance / OutOfMemoryError</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you experience a laggy interface, this can have several reasons. For
    one some chat channels are very busy and depending on your computer, this
    may not be easy to handle. Managing the userlist can cost a lot of
    performance in large channels because of having to react to hundreds of
    users joining or leaving at once. It can help to temporarily
    <a href="help.html#ignoreJoinsParts">ignore joins/parts</a> in this case.</p>
    
    <p>You may also want to check if Irc logging is enabled in the Debug Window
        (<code>Extra - Debug window - Checkbox: Irc log</code>), which should
    be disabled by default, but can lower performance if checked.</p>

        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you get this error, you started Chatty with Hotkey support, but it
    couldn't load the library (.dll) necessary to register hotkeys. This can
    either mean that the file isn't stored where the program can find it or you
    have the wrong version for your version of Java (32bit or 64bit Java need
    different versions of the .dll).</p>
    
    <p>First of all, you currently only need Global Hotkey support when you want
        to run commercials using a global hotkey. If you don't, you can just ignore
        that message or download the version of Chatty without Hotkey support.
    </p>
    <p>
        Otherwise, find out if you have the 64bit or 32bit version
        of Java, then check if you downloaded the matching Version of Chatty.
        Enter <code>/wdir</code> in Chatty to find out what your working directory
    is and make sure the JIntellitype.dll is in there.</p>
    
    <p>If you created a shortcut to open Chatty that links to Java, then your
    working directory may be the folder where Java is in, instead of the folder
    where the Chatty.jar is in. In Windows, you can change the Working Directory
    in the shortcut settings by changing what is defined under <code>Run in</code>.</p>

        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If a user is timed out in one channel, Chatty may show the timeouts in
    other channels as well. This is because there is no channel associated with
    timeouts or bans in Twitch Chat, so the program has to guess in which
    channel the timeout occured. See also: <a href="help.html#channels">Joining more than one channel</a>.</p>

        <a name="login">Can't connect because the login failed</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you repeatedly get disconnected because of possibly invalid login
    data, please open the Connect Dialog and choose <code>Configure login.. - Verify login</code>.
    This will send a request to Twitch to check if the access token is valid.
    If the login data is valid, then Twitch may just have temporary problems
    and you should try again later. The same goes for when the check itself
    fails because it can't reach the Twitch API.</p>
    <p>If the login data isn't valid, you can just remove the login and request
        new login data. Also see the <a href="#tokenDeleted">next section</a>
    for more information about invalid logins.</p>
    
    
    <h2>
        <a name="tokenDeleted">Login data (access token) was determined invalid and was removed.</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you get this message, then Chatty has performed an automatic check
    of the login data and determined that is was invalid.</p>
    <p>Reasons why the login data (access token) may be invalid:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You have requested new login data for the same Twitch Account from another instance of Chatty,
            for example on another Computer, which has automatically invalidated
            the previously requested login data (access token).</li>
        <li>You have just requested login data and something went wrong, or
        it wasn't loaded properly from the settings.</li>
        <li>The token was invalidated for some other reason.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How to proceed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Go to <code>Main - Connect - Request/Configure login ..</code> and
        get new login data. Disconnect first if you are connected.</li>
        <li>If you indeed want to use more than one instance of Chatty with the
        same account, check out <a href="help-guide1.html">this guide</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="start">Chatty won't start</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>You need to have at least Java 7 JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed to run Chatty.</p>
    <p>If you try to start Chatty by double-clicking the <code>Chatty.jar</code>,
        first make sure that <code>.jar</code> files are associated with Java,
        and not some other program like WinRAR. The icon of the <code>Chatty.jar</code>
        should have a Java icon (coffee cup). If you right-click the <code>Chatty.jar</code>
        you can select the program to open it with under <code>Open with</code>.</p>
    
    <p>If you are sure that the <code>Chatty.jar</code> is actually started with
        Java, but no program window appears, it may be that an error occured before
    the window (GUI) could be created.</p>

    <h3>Check Association of .jar with Java (Windows)</h3>
    <p>Open a commandline window and enter <code>assoc .jar</code> which should output
        <code>.jar=jarfile</code> and enter <code>ftype jarfile</code> which should
        output something like <code>"C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "%1" %*</code>
        (see also <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10875839/jar-file-keeps-giving-me-could-not-find-the-main-class-program-will-exit">
            Could not find the main class. Program will exit.</a>)</p>
    
    <h3>Run from commandline</h3>
    <p>Running Chatty from the commandline has the advantage of being able to
    get messages from before the GUI is established. Open a commandline where
    the <code>Chatty.jar</code> is located (Win7/8: Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> while Right-Clicking to open
    the context menu, click <code>Open command window here</code>) and enter
    <code>java -jar Chatty.jar</code>.</p>
    
    <h3>Error: Java is not recognized as an internal or external command (Windows)</h3>
    <p>If you experience this when entering <code>java -jar Chatty.jar</code>
    in the commandline, then it probably can't find Java because it's not in the
    <code>PATH</code> environment variable (that defines where to look
    for programs of which only the filename has been entered, not the whole path).</p>
    <p>You can enter <code>PATH</code> in a commandline window to check what is
    in it. It should show a list of semicolon-seperated directories, one of which
    should point to Java.</p>
    
    <h3>Find errors in debug.log</h3>
    <p>See next section. Of course you'll have to navigate to the folder
    manually.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="log">Debug log</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you experience any problems or errors, then there may be helpful
    information for debugging in the debug log, which is located in the settings
    directory <code>&lt;user_dir&gt;/.chatty/</code> (e.g.
    <code>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\.chatty\</code>, if you
        have Chatty running you can enter <code>/openDir</code> to open it or
        <code>/dir</code> to output the path).</p>
    <p>In that folder, there are two kinds of debug files:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <code>debug.log</code> which is overwritten everytime you start
            Chatty. It may also have a number at the end (like <code>debug.log.1</code>)
            if Java couldn't open the usual <code>debug.log</code>.</li>
        <li>Several files (<code>debug0.log, debug1.log, ..</code>), whereas
        one of them is written to at a time, and then switched to the next when
        a certain filesize is reached, rotating between a certain number of files.
        Those files are not overwritten when Chatty is started, but instead new data is appended.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So to find possibly relevant data:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If you haven't started Chatty again after the error occured, check
            the <code>debug.log</code> first.</li>
        <li>Otherwise check if one of the <code>debug0.log, debug1.log, ..</code>
            files could contain the necessary information, based on the last
        modification dates.
        <ul>
            <li>Even if the error is already some time back, it <em>may</em> still
            be in there, depending on how much data has been added in the meantime.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ol>

        <a name="0.7">Version 0.7.1</a> <a name="latest">(This one!)</a> (2014-10-26)
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You can now add your favorite Twitch Emotes to the new <code>Favorites</code>
        page of the Emote Dialog. Right-click on the emote you want to add to
        open the context-menu and click on <code>Favorite</code>, then open the
        Emote Dialog (<code>Extra - Emoticons</code> or <code>Ctrl+E</code>) and
        choose the <code>Favorites</code> page to view your favorites.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Important Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The default location to write stream information to has been changed
            to the <code>exported</code> subfolder of the settings directory (so
            e.g. <code>C:\Users\name\.chatty\exported\</code>). If you are using
            this feature e.g. by refering to the created textfiles in your
            streaming software, you'll have to adjust the path to the textfile
            there.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Full Changelog</h3>
    
<pre>
New features:
- Added Emoticon Favorites, that are displayed in the Emote Dialog (you can only
  add Twitch Emotes for now, not FFZ or BTTV)
- Added support for correct capitalization of names in chat (experimental, you
  have to enable it in the settings if you want to try it)
- Show correctly capitalized stream names in Live Streams/Channel Info Dialog
  (independent of the Correctly Capitalized Names setting)
- Added minimize to tray/close to tray options
- Added setting for auto scroll down timeout length
- Added setting to change font size of dialogs (experimental, only Userinfo now)
- Added setting to customize chat log file location
- Added context menu to Follower/Subscriber Dialog to export list to file
- Added support for FrankerFaceZ global event emotes

Changes:
- Changed tray icon to only show when needed
- Set proper tooltip for tray icon
- Added some more timestamp options
- Changed stream status writer output to "exported" subfolder of settings folder
- Changed stream status writer to ignore case of stream name
- Channel Info: Added approx. last stream length as tooltip to "Offline" text
- Changed Twitch badges to use images instead of alpha (shows new colors now)
- Changed base colors for badges to new Twitch colors (affects FFZ Mod Icon and
  Fallback Icons)
- Allow for selection of text in chat by double-clicking (focus to inputbox now
  only on single-click on chat)
- Detect a few more URL formats to be made clickable
- Improved debug logging a bit (memory usage)
- Some small improvements to memory usage
- Added some more characters to Font Selection Dialog, but also an input field
  to enter your own text to test the font
- Catch the error if hotkey library couldn't be found and output warning instead
- Updated help

Bugfixes:
- Fixed info messages sometimes going to the wrong window if popouts are used
- Fixed subscriber sorting in userlist (but overall sorting can still be screwed
  up sometimes)
- Fixed wrong channel being joined when joining channel out of user context menu
  with "Capitalize Names (First Letter)" option being enabled (fixed implicitly
  by changing some stuff around for supporting capitalized names)
- Added workaround for Twitch emotes appearing wrong on Retina displays
- Nothing to do with Chatty in particular (it's the same for every IRC client),
  but the "xy just subscribed" message should now work for everyone again,
  because Twitch fixed it :)

    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added <a href="help.html#emoticons">Emoticon Dialog</a> showing your Subscriber and Turbo emotes as
        well as channel specific emotes.</li>
        <li><a href="help.html#followers">Followers and Subscribers</a> lists
            showing your most recent followers and subscribers (you probably
            need to request new login data with the necessary access for the
            subscriber list to work).</li>
        <li>Improved <a href="help-livestreamer.html">Livestreamer Dialog and Help</a>.</li>

    <p><em>Just a reminder:</em> If you don't care about a correct userlist or joins/parts,
        you may want to switch to Twitch Client Version 3 (<code>Settings - Advanced</code>),
        which has a few advantages.

            username, addressbook category and channel, then choose whether to
            completely hide them, show how many were ignored every 30s (if any)
            or show which users where ignored. Ignored messages also get added
            to a seperate window so you can check them if you want to.</li>
        <li>Improved Update Notification.</li>

    <h3>Important Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Addressbook categories are now all lowercase. If you have any
        categories that only use case to differentiate between them, this might

    </h2>
    <h3>Important Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Right-click on a tab to not only <code>Close</code> but also
            <code>Popout</code> the channel.</li>
        <li>Using the commercial hotkey now will simulate a click on the
            <code>30s</code> button <em>if</em> the Admin Dialog is open on the
        Commercials tab.</li>

<h2>
    <a name="0.6.2">Version 0.6.2 (2014-04-20)</a>
    <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
</h2>
    <h3>Important Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The port setting has changed. If you have changed the port setting
        to another value before, it will be reverted to the new default with
        this update.</li>
        <li>With the introduction of group chat, Twitch apparently removed the
        "xy just subscribed" messages from the chat version Chatty uses. There
        was also a new version introduced that still has those messages and is
        generally better (association of bans/info messages/subscribers to
        channels), but it lacks joins/parts, which means no joins/parts can be
        shown and the userlist will only contain those people who have said
        something.<br />
        <br />
        If you don't care about showing joins/parts and you don't care about
        a correct/complete userlist, then it may be beneficial for you to
        enable the <code>Chat Client Version 3</code> option in the Settings
        Dialog under <code>Advanced</code>. <a href="help-settings.html#Advanced-Other">More information..</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Full Changelog</h3>
<pre>
New features:
- Admin Dialog: Select previously used or favorited stream status (title/game)
  from the presets dialog for your title changing convenience
- Optional new chat version that has no joins/parts but has better channel
  association for bans/timeouts/subscribers and "xy just subscribed" message
- Added /slap command due to S'ome demand
- Improved connecting to chat (automatically trying different servers/ports)
- Added more shortcuts and stuff
- Added option to rejoin currently open channels when connecting

Changes:
- Moved Ignore joins/parts option to settings dialog
- Some small improvements
- Updated help

Bugfixes:
- Hopefully fixed synchronization error
- Fixed error when editing game favorites
- Fixed error when no stream title is set

</h2>
<h3>Import Information</h3>
<ul>
    <li>With Version 0.5, Chatty can notify you about streams you follow and
        show a list of them. You have to request
        new login data containing <code>&lt;Read user info&gt;</code> access to
        be able to use that. Go to 
        <code>&lt;Main - Connect - Configure login..&gt;</code>, remove the

</ul>
<h3>Full Changelog</h3>
<pre>
New features:
- Get notified when streams you follow go online (requires
  &lt;Read user info&gt; access, which wasn't even in Chatty before, so you'll
  have to request new login data)
- View a list of live streams (you followed or whose channel you are in)
- FrankerFaceZ emoticons
- Added search, allowing you to find text in the current chat window
- Deleted messages (from timeouts/bans) now get shortened to a maximum length,
  or you can use the previous behaviour or let the whole message be replaced
  with &lt;message deleted&gt;
- Change the displayed time range in Viewer History
- Automatically check if the login is valid, if it is suspected not to be
- Clickable links in Channel Info Dialog (also turns #srl-abcd into a race link)
- Cycle between tabs with Ctrl+TAB

Changes:
- Updated Help
- Changed Settings Dialog Layout
- Detect subscribers even when in more than one channel (may not work correctly
  always, but it's a better guess than before)

Bugfixes:
- Changed color of inputbox cursor to foreground color
- Possibly made emoticon image loading a bit more reliable, but it's hard to
  tell what happens when the loading fails
- Handle long URLs in the URL open dialog better

    <p>When in a channel, Chatty shows some information about that channel
    in the titlebar, e.g.:<br /><cite>[40|59] - GTA:SA Speedruns (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas)</cite></p>
    <p>The first number is the number of people in the chat, the second is the
    viewercount, followed by the current stream title and game. Anything other
    than the number of people in the chat is requested from the Twitch API about
    every two minutes.</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="login">Login data</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>The login data consists of a <em>username</em> (or account name) and most importantly an <em>access token</em>, which is sort of a
    revokable password that can also have different types of access associated with it, some of them being:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chat access (which is obviously needed for Chatty)</li>
        <li>Read user info (which is required to request the streams you follow)</li>
        <li>Editor access (which allows you to change the title/game of your stream)</li>
        <li>Commercials access (which allows you to run commercials on your stream)</li>
        <li>Show subscribers (which allows you to show a list of your subscribers, not to confuse with followers)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once requested from Twitch, the login data is stored locally on your computer
    along with the other settings of Chatty. Since Twitch gives out the access token
    per application, any access token for the same account requested with Chatty
    will be invalidated when you request a new access token.</p>
    <p>If getting login data fails, read <a href="help-guide2.html">this guide</a>.</p>
    <h3><a name="access">Allow more access</a></h3>
    <p>To allow Chatty more access than it already has (e.g. if you haven't selected
        editor access before, but you want it now),
        you need to request a new access token.
    Just go to <code>Main - Connect - Configure login</code> (you have to be disconnected), delete the login
    and request it again with the necessary access.</p>
    
    <h3>Allow less access</h3>
    <p>To allow Chatty less access than it already has (e.g. you don't want it
        to have editor access anymore) you need to first revoke access
        completely in your Twitch Account
        <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections">Settings</a>, then
        authorize access again. What will not work is just requesting a new
        token without selecting the now unwanted access. Twitch will always
        respond with a token that has at least as much access as the previous
        one.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="login-security">Security</a></h3>
    <p>The access token is saved in the <code>login</code> file in the settings
        <a href="help-guide_folders.html">directory</a> and can thus be accessed
        by anyone having access to your computer.
    It allows anyone who obtains it to chat in your name and access the other
    things listed above (if you allowed it when getting the token). If you think
    the token may have been compromised, please immediately delete it and
    <em>request a new one</em> (which will invalidate any previously issued)
    or go to your Twitch Settings subsection
    <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections">Connections</a>
    and <em>revoke the accesss</em> there.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="symbols">Symbols used in chat</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>There are a few special symbols that are used for users in chat. These
    are displayed in the userlist and - if usericons are disabled - also in chat.</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>~ The Streamer</li>
        <li>@ Moderators</li>
        <li>! Admins</li>
        <li>!! Staff</li>
        <li>+ Turbo users</li>
        <li>% Subscribers</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="http://frankerfacez.com">FrankerFaceZ</a> provides a custom
    mod icon for some channels. You can disable this in the settings if you
    want to keep the default one for all channels.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="nickCompletion">Nick Completion</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Enter the beginning of a nick of a user that is currently online, then
        press TAB to auto-complete it. For example entering <code>jo</code> and
        pressing TAB may change it to <code>joshimuz</code>. If there is no
        matching nick, nothing will happen. If there is more than one matching nick,
        you can cycle through them by pressing TAB repeatedly. For example
        <code>jo</code> might cycle between <code>john</code>, <code>jolzi</code>
        and <code>joshimuz</code>.</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="inputHistory">Input History</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>When you send a message, it is automatically saved into a input history,
        which you can access (while having the cursor in the input box) by pressing
        the <kbd>Up-Arrow</kbd>-key, which will replace the current contents of
        the input box with the previously send message. You can go further back and
        forth again using <kbd>Up-Arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Down-Arrow</kbd>.</p>
    <p>Pressing <kbd>Down-Arrow</kbd> after entering or changing a message, 
        removes it and stores it in the history, so you can go back to it and send
        it later. Pressing <kbd>Up-Arrow</kbd> after entering or changing a message
        will replace it with the previous history entry without saving it.</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="channels">Joining more than one channel</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p><em>This only applies when you use <code>Twitch Client Version 1</code>
            (see <code>Advanced</code> settings, <a href="help-settings.html#Advanced-TC">more Information..</a>)</em></p>
    <p>It is possible to join more than one channel with Chatty, however it
        does have some disadvantages. Several messages from the Chat-Server don't
        have a channel associated with them (Bans/Timeouts, Specialusers), so while being
        joined to more than one channel on a single connection, they can't be reliably
        associated with a channel.</p>
    <p>Joining more than one channel means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bans/Timeouts are shown in all open channels where the username
            that was Banned/Timed out was found in, or if it wasn't found all
            open channels.</li>
        <li>Subscribers should be recognized immediately or at least after
            writing two messages, but it may not always work reliably.</li>
        <li>Info messages from the Twitch chat (like <cite>This channel is now in slow-mode</cite>) are displayed in the currently
            active channel, which may not be the channel the message was meant for.</li>
        <li>Admin/Staff/Turbo users should be global, so these shouldn't pose
            a problem.</li>
        <li>Moderators work differently, so those shouldn't be a problem
            either.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="favorites">Favorites / History</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If enabled, the history automatically saves channels you join and when
    you last joined them. By default channels expire from the history after
    30 days of not joining them (can be changed).</p>
    <p>You can also add channels from the history or any
    you enter manually to the favorites, which will always be kept until you
    remove them yourself.</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="highlight">Highlight</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>The highlight system allows you to add words or phrases that make chat
    messages appear in another color and appear in a seperate window, which you can
    open under <code>View - Highlights</code> (you can clear the highlights window
    in it's context menu).</p>
    <div class="moreInfo">More information: <a href="help-settings.html#Highlight">Highlight Settings</a></div>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="ignore">Ignore</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>The ignore system works very similiar to the highlight system, just that
        it hides messages instead of highlighting them. They however also get
        added to a seperated window, which you can open under <code>View - Ignored</code>
        (you can clear the messagess in the window in it's context menu).</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="userColors">User Colors</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>The color of a user is displayed in the User Info Dialog. Color Names
    are used where possible, HTML Color Codes are displayed in the Tooltip.
    Colors with asterisk (*) are default colors (the user hasn't set one
    or hasn't said anything during this session yet). A color in parentheses
    means it's the original color, while the other color is the corrected one
    that is actually displayed.</p>
    <h3>Corrected Colors</h3>
    <p>Chatty attempts to make colors more readable automatically by changing
    them to increase contrast. This doesn't work very well though, although it
    should work for extreme cases like white on white or black on black.</p>
    
    <h3>Custom Colors</h3>
    <p>You can also specify custom colors for certain users or types of users
    in the settings. Custom colors are indicated by two asterisks (**) in the
    User Info Dialog.</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="emoticons">Emoticons/Emote Dialog</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>Chatty supports the default Twitch Emoticons (Normal/Turbo/Subscriber),
    which should work the same as in normal Twitch Chat. It however also
    supports <a href="http://frankerfacez.com/">FrankerFaceZ</a>, a custom
    set of emotes that is normally made available in normal Twitch Chat by use of browser
    extensions. It also supports some of the
    <a href="http://www.nightdev.com/betterttv/">BetterTTV</a> emotes.</p>
    
    <p>You can enable/disable Emoticons in general (displaying the icons instead
        of the text) in the settings under <code>Emoticons</code>. You can also
    ignore specific emotes in the same place in the settings.</p>
    
    <p>In chat you can right-click on an emoticon to show some info about it.
        Click on the emote code (e.g. <code>FrankerZ</code>) in the context menu
        to insert the emote in the inputbox. If it is a subscriber emote, you
        also have some more options.</p>
    
    <h3>Emote Dialog</h3>
    <p>Use <code>Extra - Emoticons</code> or press <kbd>Ctrl-E</kbd> to open
        the Emote Dialog, which has three different pages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <code>Favorites</code> page lists emotes you have added to the favorites
        via the Emote Context Menu (right-click on an emote in the dialog or chat and
        choose <code>Favorite</code>, emotes that already are favorited can be
        removed from favorites the same way).</li>
        <li>The <code>My Emotes</code> page lists the emotes you paid for (Subemotes/Turbo).</li>
        <li>The <code>Channel Emotes</code> page lists the emotes that are specific to the current channel
        (FFZ and BTTV, if there are any). It also includes
    the subscriber emotes of the current channel (if it has any), whether you
    can use them or not (but it displays a message if you are not subscribed).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Click on an emote to insert it into the current channel inputbox. Double-click
        on an emote to also close the Emote Dialog in the process, or press <kbd>ESC</kbd> or
    <kbd>Ctrl-E</kbd> to close it. Right-click on an emote to show a context menu
    with some more information/options.</p>
    
    <p><em>Note that you need to have joined at least one channel for your subemotes/turbo emotes
        to show up, because only then does Twitch Chat send that information to the client.</em></p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="addressbook">Addressbook</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>The addressbook allows you to add usernames and assign categories to
        them, which can then be used in other places such as the <a href="help-settings.html#Usercolors">Usercolor settings</a>
        or the <a href="help-settings.html#Highlight">Highlight settings</a>.
        Categories cannot contain spaces and are all made lowercase when added/loaded from file.</p>
    <p>The addressbook can be edited in several ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The addressbook dialog (<code>&lt;Main Menu&gt; - Channels - Addressbook</code>)
        where all entries are listed and you can add/edit/remove entries.</li>
        <li>From the user context menu (when you click on a user, then <code>Addressbook</code>)
        where the entry for this user can be directly added/edited/removed. There
        you can just select/unselect the categories this user should be in
        (although only the categories that are already used in the addressbook
        are listed, so if you want to add a completely
        new category, you have to add it once by manually editing an entry).</li>
        <li>The commands that are listed below.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Commands</h3>
    <p>In addition to the addressbook dialog and user context menu, there are also some commands to
        edit the addressbook. All commands are prefixed with <code>/ab</code>
        (e.g. <code>/ab add &lt;name&gt;</code>) or alternatively <code>/users</code> (e.g. <code>/users add &lt;name&gt;</code>):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>add &lt;name&gt;</code> - Adds a name</li>
        <li><code>add &lt;name&gt; &lt;categories&gt;</code> - Adds a name and directly assigns it the given categories, or adds the
            categories to the name if it already exists (categories are comma-seperated, without spaces)</li>
        <li><code>set &lt;name&gt; &lt;categories&gt;</code> - Sets the categories for this name, adding it if necessary, replacing
            any present categories for this name</li>
        <li><code>remove &lt;name&gt;</code> - Completely removes the given name</li>
        <li><code>remove &lt;name&gt; &lt;categories&gt;</code> - Removes the given categories from this name, but leaves
            the name</li>
        <li><code>change &lt;name&gt; &lt;categoriesModification&gt;</code> - Prepend categories with <code>+</code>,
            <code>-</code> or <code>!</code> to add, remove or toggle the categories respectively. You can specify more than
            one set of categories, for example: <code>change test +a,b -c !d</code> adds a and b, removes c and toggles d</li>
        <li><code>get &lt;name&gt;</code> - Shows the categories for this name</li>
        <li><code>info</code> - Shows number of entries and used categories</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Categories are given as a comma-seperated list without spaces, e.g. <code>cat1,cat2,cat3</code>.</p>
    <p>The following commands edit all entries at once, so they should be used with care:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>renameCategory &lt;currentName&gt; &lt;newName&gt;</code> - Renames a category, which means all occurences
            of <code>currentName</code> are replaced with <code>newName</code> in all entries. This can also
            be used to merge categories, if <code>newName</code> already exists.</li>
        <li><code>removeCategory &lt;name&gt;</code> - Removes the category with the given name from all entries</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Command Examples</h3>

    <h2>
        <a name="channelinfo">Channel Info / History</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>The Channel Info Dialog shows the current stream status of the active
    stream. The data is requested from the Twitch API in a semi-regular interval,
    so it can take some time to update.</p>
    
    <h3>Online Time</h3>
    <p>If the stream is online, the <code>Online: 1h 30m</code>
    shows how long ago the stream was started. That time comes directly from the
    Twitch API, so it is able to show the correct online time, even if you started
    Chatty after the stream started.</p>
    
    <p>If there is a time in parentheses
    (like <code>1h 30m (2h)</code>), then that time denotes how long the stream
    was online, but including small offline periods (PICNICs) of at most 10 minutes,
    which means that this time is more of a guess of what might be expected as
    stream online time and also depends on when Chatty got the data (if you join
    the channel after a PICNIC, then it won't include the time before, because it
    never received the data for it).</p>
    
    <h3>History Graph</h3>
    <p>The History is a graph that shows the development of the viewers
                    of the currently active channel and also indicates stream status changes
                    (online/offline/title/game) by different colors.</p>
                <p>Hover over points to display the stream status and viewercount
                at that time. Right-click for a context-menu.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                
                <p>There are two ways to change which time range is being displayed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Time Range</strong> means only the last <em>x hours</em>
                        are being displayed. For example if the whole data spans 10 hours
                        you can choose to only display the last 2 hours. This will display
                        the <em>maximum range</em> after the <em>actual range</em>
                        (even if the <em>actual range</em> isn't as long as the
                        <em>maximum range</em>):<br />
                        <code>15:32 - 19:14 (2h)</code><br />
                        You can change this via the context menu.
                    </li>
                    <li style="padding-top: 5px"><strong>Fixed Start/End</strong> means that either
                    the beginning of the displayed data is fixed or both the
                    beginning and end of the data are fixed, meaning that the
                    displayed graph will never change. The times that show the
                    <em>actual range</em> indicate whether they are fixed:<br />
                    <code>|15:58| - 19:14</code> or <code>|15:58| - |18:20|</code><br />
                    Double-click on a point to set it as a fixed start, then
                    double-click on another point to set it as a fixed end.
                    Double-click anywhere else to clear fixed start/end.
                    This setting is channel-specific and isn't saved when you

    </table>
                <p>The History is recorded while you have the channel open in Chatty
                as well as for all followed channels, if you have that feature
                enabled.</p>
                <p>The shown data usually fits to the available vertical space
                (so if the min/max viewercounts were 341/403 then only this
                range is shown). If you choose <code>Toggle Vertical</code> in
                the context-menu, you can switch between the shown range
                (min/max) and the full range (0-max).</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="notifications">Live Streams / Notifications</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>Chatty can show Notifications when the status of a stream changes.
        There is also a Live Streams window (<code>Channels - Live Channels</code>)
        that shows the currently live streams. Both these features always include channels you have
        joined and - if enabled - channels you have followed. Streams that are
        no longer online, or whose channels you have left and you don't follow,
        are added to a list that you can open in the Live Streams window context
        menu (<code>Removed streams..</code>).</p>
    
    <h3>Notifications</h3>
    <p>Chatty Notifications are little info boxes that can be shown for stream
    status changes and highlighted messages. When you left-click on a notification
    it is closed immediately, right-clicking closes it as well and in addition
    also joins the associated channel.</p>
    
    <div class="moreInfo">More information: <a href="help-settings.html#Notifications">Notification Settings</a></div>
    
    <h3><a name="followed">Followed Streams</a></h3>
    <p>Chatty can request a list of streams you follow on a regular basis, so
    you have both an overview of currently live streams as well as be
    informed about status changes (offline -> online, title change, game change).
    This is always available for streams whose channels you have joined in chat,
    but with this feature enabled, this works for all streams you follow even
    without joining their channel.</p>
    <p>This feature requires <code>Read user info</code> access, so Chatty can
        request your followed streams. Read the <a href="#login">section about login</a>
    to learn more about login data and access.</p>
    <p>You can enable/disable this feature in the Settings under <code>Notifications</code>.</p>

    <h2>

        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>You can open a list of the <em>Followers</em> of a channel by joining that channel
        and then opening the Followers Dialog via <code>Extra - Followers</code>.
    It always opens on the currently active channel, or if you are in no channel
    at all, your own channel.</p>
    
    <p>You can open a list of your <em>Subscribers</em> by opening the Subscribers Dialog
        via <code>Extra - Subscribers</code>. It always opens on your own channel,
    because you can only display the Subscribers of your own channel. If you don't
    have any Subscribers, it will simply show an empty list (and an error). You
    also need to have selected the necessary <a href="#login">access</a> when
    requesting login data.</p>
    
    <p>You can save the current list to a file by right-clicking on the dialog
    (not the list) and selecting the format.</p>
    
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>Both the Followers and Subscribers Dialog otherwise work in pretty much
        the same way. Data is only requested as long as you have the dialog open. It
        is requested in a semi-regular interval and then displays that data in the
        list (and some stats).</p>
    <p>If followers/following is mentioned below, then the same applies for
    subscribers/subscribing in the appropriate dialog.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top">
                <p>At the top it shows some stats:</p>

                    <li><strong>Total:</strong> The total number of followers (not to be confused
                    with the followers shown in the list, which are the most recent 100).
                    After the total number, it shows the change compared
                    to the last update, e.g. <code>Total: 3.190 (+2)</code>,
                    which will stay there until the next update.</li>
                    <li><strong>Week/Day/Hour:</strong> These are some stats based
                    on the current list shown below. It shows how many followers
                    there are in the list that followed in the last 7 days (Week), 24 hours (Day) and
                    60 minutes (Hour). (So <em>Day</em> does NOT mean <em>Today</em>
                    as in since 0:00.)<br /><br />
                    If it says <code>99+</code> it means that there are more than
                    99 followers in that timespan, but Chatty can't determine whether
                    it's 100 or more than 100, because the list only contains the
                    100 most recent followers.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>At the bottom, it shows approximately how long ago data was last received,
                or a short error message if an error occured.</p>
            </td>

    </table>
    
    <h3>About New Followers/Refollows</h3>
    <p>Everything that determines whether a follower is new or a refollow is
    saved per session. So if you restart Chatty, it assumes that all followers
    except from the first request are new. So if you start Chatty, open the
    Followers Dialog on your channel, it will load the followers for the first
    time and show none of them as new. Now if it updates a minute later, and there
    are users it hasn't seen as having followed before, then it assumes these
    users as new followers.</p>
    
    <p>Now a user of course might have been a follower for a year, then unfollow
        and follow again. Chances are that Chatty won't notice that and assume a new
        follower. What it however does is that it only shows each user as new follower
        <em>once per session</em>. So if someone follows and Chatty shows that user as a new follower,
        then that user unfollows and follows again, Chatty will notice that the first
        and the second follow time are different, and will show this user as a refollow
        (the name slightly grey).</p>
    
    <p>So this basicially just prevents the same user from e.g. making a sound
        go off (if you have that enabled) several times just by refollowing several
        times. At most that will happen once per session. Other than that
        the data is mostly shown just as it comes in from Twitch. It will still
        show refollows on the top of the list.</p>

        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>There are a couple of commands that allow you to change settings from
        the chat inputbox. <em>You should know what you're doing
        before using these.</em> <code>/set &lt;setting&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code>
    changes a setting, <code>/get &lt;setting&gt;</code> shows the current value
    of a setting, <code>/reset &lt;setting&gt;</code> resets the setting to
    the default (hard-coded) value, <code>/clearsetting &lt;setting&gt;</code> sets
    string settings to an empty string.</p>
    <p>Some of the available settings include (this list may be incomplete/incorrect):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Font: <code>font</code>, <code>fontSize</code>, <code>lineSpacing</code></li>
        <li>Colors (each taking a named color or html color code):
            <code>backgroundColor</code>,
            <code>foregroundColor</code>,
            <code>infoColor</code>,
            <code>compactColor</code>,
            <code>inputForegroundColor</code>,
            <code>inputBackgroundColor</code>
        </li>
        <li><code>timeoutButtons</code> (a comma-seperated list of numbers (time in seconds)
            defining the timeout-buttons in the UserInfo dialog)</li>
        <li><code>timestamp</code> (a String defining the timestamp format, "off" means no timestamp),
            <code>timestampTimezone</code> (set the timezone for the timestamp, e.g. "GMT+2" or "PST")</li>
        <li><code>token</code> (the access token to use for connecting)</li>
        <li><code>username</code> (the name to use for connecting)</li>
        <li><code>usePassword</code> (whether to use a password for connecting
            instead of an access token)</li>
        <li><code>twitchnotifyAsInfo</code> (show messages from user "twitchnotify" as
        info messages)</li>
        <li><code>spamProtection</code> (how many messages are allowed, "message/seconds", e.g. "19/30")</li>
        <li><code>abCommands</code> (Which Addressbook commands should be allowed for moderators,
        comma-seperated without spaces, any of the ones that can be used with the /ab prefix)</li>
        <li><code>abCommandsChannel</code> (Enable Addressbook commands for moderators in the given
        channel, reset this setting to default to disable feature again)</li>
        <li><code>abUniqueCats</code> (Comma-seperated list of categories that
            will be unique to one user at a time, only enforced if you use the addressbook <code>add</code>/<code>set</code>
            commands, once you specify a unique category with those commands the addressbook command <code>removeCategory</code>
        is performed before executing the rest of the command)</li>
        <li><code>serverDefault/portDefault, server/port</code> (what server/port to connect to,
        first set is the default one that can be changed in the settings dialog and is saved in between
        sessions, the second set comes from the commandline parameters and overrides the default ones
        when connecting)</li>
        <li><code>backupDelay</code>, <code>backupCount</code> (How many days to wait in between
            <a href="help-guide_folders.html#backup">backups</a>, how many backups to keep)</li>

    </h2>
    <p>Settings are loaded from files when Chatty is started and saved into files
        once it is closed. By default these files are saved in a subfolder
        <code>.chatty</code> of your user directory. You can also use the
        <code>-cd</code> commandline parameter to use the current working
    directory instead. You can find out which folder is used by entering the
    <code>/dir</code> command.</p>
    <p>Since Version 0.4 of Chatty, the settings are no longer saved in a single
        <code>settings</code>-file, but instead several files:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>login</code>: Contains the login data, including the access
        token, which should be kept confidential.</li>
        <li><code>favoritesAndHistory</code>: Contains channel history and
        favorites, as well as game favorites.</li>
        <li><code>settings</code>: The main file, which contains all customizations
        made to Chatty that should not be confidential or private.</li>
        <li><code>statusPresets</code>: Contains status (title/game) presets
        from the Admin Dialog.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This page details some of the settings in the Settings Dialog
        (<code>Main Menu - Settings</code>). Also try hovering over settings
    in the settings dialog itself, sometimes you can get a tooltip with some
    additional information. You can open this help in the settings dialog by
    clicking on the "Help" link on the bottom left.</p>

        immediately and join the channels specified in the field below. You can
        define several channels by seperating them with a comma.</li>
        <li><strong>Connect and join previously open channels</strong> - Connect

    </h2>
    <h3>Deleted Messages (Timeouts/Bans)</h3>
    <p>This allows you to define how timeouts or bans are displayed in Chatty.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are three options for deleted messages:<ul>
        <li><strong>Delete Message</strong> completely replaces the message with
            <code>&lt;message deleted&gt;</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Strike through</strong> will keep the whole message displayed, but
        crossed out.</li>
        <li><strong>Strike through, shorten</strong> is same as the previous one, but
        it will also shorten the message to the defined number of characters, so long
        spam messages don't take as much space, but can mostly still be identified what
        they were about. Shortened messages are indicated by the points at the end
        that are <em>not</em> crossed out (e.g. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Deleted spam message Long copy pas</span>..).</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>Show ban messages</strong>: In addition to handling the deleted
        message, Chatty can also show a message like
        <code>&lt;name&gt; has been banned from talking</code> once the timeout
    or ban is issued.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine ban messages</strong>: Chatty can combine ban messages,
    which means if several bans/timeouts are issued for the same user within 10
    seconds, only one message is shown for them, with the number of bans shown
    after the message, e.g. <code>&lt;name&gt; has been banned from talking (3)</code>.
    Ban messages are not combined if a new message from the banned user was
    received in the meantime.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Timestamp</strong>: Whether to show a timestamp in front of
        chat messages and what format it should have. If you want a different
        format from the ones provided here, you can use the command
        <code>/set timestamp &lt;format&gt;</code>. The format can be anything
        specified by the Java
        <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">SimpleDateFormat</a>
        class.</li>
        <li><strong>Capitalized Names</strong> simply capitalizes the first letter of
    names, it doesn't make the names capitalized correctly as they are on the
    Twitch Profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Show mod/unmod messages</strong>: Whether to show the MOD/UNMOD
            messages as they come in from Twitch Chat (which are used to show the
            moderator badge). These messages can be sometimes
        be kind of broken (on Twitch's side) and can show some or all mods in the channel
        as being modded/unmodded.</li>
        <li><strong>Show stream status in chat</strong> outputs the stream status
        (title and game) in the chat window on join and when it changes
        (when the stream goes offline or online or changes the title or game).</li>
        <li><strong>/me messages colored</strong>: Show action messages colored
        like in webchat.</li>
        <li><strong>Filter combining characters</strong>: Removes a number of
        Unicode characters from incoming messages that are used in some
        languages to combine characters, but can apparently cause errors in some
        cases.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><a name="capitalization">Name Capitalization</a></h3>
    <p>Names in Twitch Chat are send all-lowercase by default, so there is no way
    to correctly capitalize them from that alone. There are two ways to change
    capitalization:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Capitalized Names (First Letter)</strong> simply makes the
        first letter of names uppercase. This will be correct for many names,
        but by far not for all (names might have capital letters in the middle
        or be all-lowercase).</li>
        <li><strong>Correctly Capitalized Names</strong> requests the actual
        correct capitalization from the Twitch API. Can also be combined with
        the previous option. This is rather experimental and more
        resource-intensive. The paragrahps below explain this in more detail.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>You can enable <strong>Correctly Capitalized Names</strong>, however be
    aware of the limitations: Because capitalization for names has to be
    requested from the Twitch API one by one, it is a rather slow process if you
    don't want to spam the API too much. Names of users that are more active in
    chat are requested with higher priority. This way it should work somewhat
    well in small chats where only a few different people are talking, but don't
    expect capitalization to be always correct. Names are cached rather long
    locally (basicially forever, but they may be re-requested to update
    capitalization in case it changed). Capitalization is also used from data
    that is retrieved anyway: The Follower/Subscriber lists (if open) and the
    Stream Information of channels you have open or that you follow (and that
    are live).</p>
    
    <p>Commands:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/refreshCase &lt;name&gt;</code> - Manually request capitalization
        for a single name, also resets a manually set capitalization to default.</li>
        <li><code>/setCase &lt;capitalized_name&gt;</code> - Manually set a fixed
        capitalization, which will never change unless you change it manually
        again or use <code>/refreshCase</code> on that name.</li>
        <li><code>/getCase &lt;name&gt;</code> - Display information about the
        capitalization for the given name.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Emoticons">Emoticons</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>General Settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Show emoticons</strong>: Shows emoticons as images instead
        of just the text</li>
        <li><strong>Enable BetterTTV Emotes</strong>: Shows some of the BetterTTV emotes.
        <em>Requires a restart to take effect when you change it.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Enable FrankerFaceZ (FFZ)</strong>: Downloads <a href="help.html#emoticons">FrankerFaceZ</a>
            emotes and Mod Icons (where available). <em>Requires a restart to take
                effect when you change it.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Enable FFZ Mod Icon</strong>: Show the FFZ Mod Icon instead of the regular
            Mod Icon (where available). <em>Requires FrankerFaceZ setting to be enabled.</em></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Ignored Emotes</h3>
    <p>Emotes added to this list will not be turned into an image, but instead
        are just shown as their emote code.</p>
    <p>The code added to the list has to be the
    exact code used internally to find the emote in the messages. Usually this is simply
    the emote code as you would type it in chat, but some emotes have a special syntax
    that you might not even know (e.g. <code>:)</code> has <code>\:-?\)</code> as actual code).
    It is recommended to use the emote context menu (right-click on an emote in chat) to
    ignore emotes, because then the correct code will automatically be added to
    the list.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Usericons">Usericons</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>Usericon Settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Show Usericons</strong>: Shows badges as images instead of
        just text</li>
        <li><strong>Enable Custom Usericons</strong>: Use the custom icons
        defined in the table below</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By adding entries to the table you can either replace the default icons (Mod, Turbo, Subscriber, ..)
    or add additional icons for certain users or addressbook categories. The order
    of the entries can matter, they are matched from the top, so if more than one
    icon matches that is supposed to replace a default icon, then the first one
    is used. If more than one <code>Addon</code> icon matches, then all are used
    (unless you use the <code>$stop</code> restriction, see section <em>Restriction</em> below).</p>
    
    <p>You have the following options when you add/edit an item:</p>
    <dl class="paragraphs">
        <dt>Type</dt>
        <dd>The type determines whether a default icon will be replaced
            (if you choose <code>Moderator, Subscriber, Turbo, ..</code>) or if
            it should be an additional icon added after the default ones (<code>Addon</code>).
            Currently, you can have as many Addon-Icons as you want and they are
            all displayed at once (if they match the requirements of course).</dd>
        
        <dt>Restriction</dt>
        <dd>This is similiar to the <a href="#Usercolors">Usercolors</a> settings,
        where you can enter special restrictions the user has to match in order
        for the icon to be displayed. What makes the most sense in this case is
        probably just entering a username (e.g. <code>serenity</code>) or an
        addressbook category (e.g. <code>$cat:vip</code>, which would refer to
        the category <code>vip</code>). If you keep this empty, then no restriction
        is applied.</dd>
        <dd>Specifying a <em>Type</em> other than <code>Addon</code> carries an
        implicit restriction, since e.g. the default moderator icons are only
        displayed if the user is a moderator.</dd>
        <dd>Normally you can only specify <em>one</em> restriction, but you can
            also add the special restriction <code>$stop</code> for <code>Addon</code>
            icons, which means if this icon matches (and is thus used), it stops
            searching for further <code>Addon</code> icons. So it's not really
            a restriction for <em>this</em> icon, but rather a restriction that
            affects the following icons and can be used to limit the number of <code>Addon</code> icons.</dd>
        
        <dt>Channel</dt>
        <dd>This is another requirement that also has to be met in order for the
        icon to be displayed. You can entere a channel name here, so that the
        icon will only be displayed in that channel. You can add an exclamation
        mark in front of the channel name (like <code>!#channel</code>) to have
        it displayed in all channels except the one you specified. If you keep
        this empty, then it will be displayed in all channels.</dd>
        
        <dt>Image File</dt>
        <dd>The image file to use for the icon. Must be a <code>.png</code> and
        should usually be about 18x18 pixels (because that is the size of the
        default icons). The image files are looked for in the <code>/img</code>
        subfolder of the working directory (similiar to the <code>/sounds</code>
        folder). You can click on <code>Image Folder</code> to show information
        about it and rescan it to update the list of images in the dropdown menu.</dd>
        <dd>You can add the special Image File name <code>$ffz</code> which will
        make it use a FrankerFaceZ icon for that, if available (this only really
        applies if you use the <em>Type</em> <code>Moderator</code> and want to
        replace the moderator icon in all channels execept the ones that have a
        FFZ Mod Icon).</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Usercolors">Usercolors</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>This allows you to specify your own usercolors for either certain types
        of users (mod, subscriber etc.) or specific usernames. There are special
    items that you can use to specify that (to specify a username, just enter
    it without anything else):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>$mod</code> - Moderators</li>
        <li><code>$sub</code> - Subscribers</li>
        <li><code>$turbo</code> - Turbo Users</li>
        <li><code>$admin</code> - Admins</li>
        <li><code>$staff</code> - Staff members</li>
        <li><code>$all</code> - All users, this can be used to specify a default
        color (should be put at the very end of the list)</li>
        <li><code>$broadcaster</code> - Broadcasters</li>
        <li><code>$cat:&lt;category&gt;</code> - A category from the <a href="help.html#addressbook">Addressbook</a></li>
        <li><code>#&lt;color code&gt;</code> - A Html color code, e.g. <code>#0000FF</code> for blue, which can
            be used to replace colors</li>
        <li><code>$color:&lt;color code or name&gt;</code> - A Html color code or name (names
            as hardcoded into Chatty, may be different from other programs), e.g. <code>$color:Blue</code> for blue,
            which can be used to replace colors</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The order of the
    entries in the table matters, because it is checked from the top. If you
    were to put the <code>$all</code> item at the very top, any items below
    wouldn't do anything, because the first item would already match all users.
    This e.g. allows you to specify what color a user should have when he is
    both a subscriber and a moderator (by either putting <code>$mod</code>
    or <code>$sub</code> first).</p>
    
    <p>If an item is red and has "(error)" appended (e.g. "<span style="color:red">$color.Blue (error)</span>"),
    this means the item is invalid. In the example this is because a point has
    been used instead of a colon, so "$color:Blue" would be correct. This can
    also happen if it doesn't recognize the given color or the item is just in
    an invalid format.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Highlight">Highlight</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>General settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enable Highlight</strong>: Determines whether highlighting
        is enabled at all.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight own name</strong>: Makes messages that contain your
        own name (case-insensitive) highlighted, even if you didn't add it to the list manually.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight own text</strong>: Highlights your own messages if
        they match the criteria, which can be particularly useful to test whether your terms
        are being matched correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight follow-up</strong>: After a highlighted message,
        also highlight the following messages of the same user for a certain time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Add terms to be highlighted</h3>
    <p>Add items to the list to make a message highlighted if any one of them
    match the message. The following two types of prefixes can be used to change
    highlighting behaviour per item.</p>
    
    <h3>Text Matching Prefixes</h3>
    <p>By default, matching is done case-insensitive and when the word or phrase
        appears anywhere in the message. However, you can add the following
        prefixes in front of the text to change this matching behaviour. You can
        only use one of these prefixes per item, because all text following the
        prefix is interpreted as text to match.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>cs:</code> makes it case-sensitive, so <code>cs:test</code>
            matches <code>test</code> but not <code>Test</code>.</li>
        <li><code>w:</code> matches at word boundaries, e.g. <code>w:anna</code>
            will match <code>anna</code> or <code>Anna:</code> but not
            <code>Hannah</code> or <code>annah</code>. <em>(Is actually just a
                shortcut for a special regex, so special regex characters will work.)</em></li>
        <li><code>wcs:</code> is the same as <code>w:</code>, but case-sensitive.</li>
        <li><code>re:</code> to use a regular expression, e.g. <code>re:(?i).*GTA ?[V5].*</code>
        to match GTA5, GTA 5, GTA V, gta5, .. anywhere in the message. Note
        that the regex always tries to match the entire message, so you have to
        add the appropriate wildcards to match parts anywhere in the message.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Meta Prefixes</h3>
    <p>The following prefixes mostly influence which messages are matched,
        however they don't change the matching of the text itself, but instead
        provide other information for the highlight system. They can be
        placed in front of the Text Matching Prefixes (or the text if you don't
        have any other prefixes) and you can even use more than one per item.
        These prefixes have to be seperated from eachother and the text by a
        space.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>user:</code> to specifiy one exact username (case-insensitive)
            which should highlight only if this user send the message, doesn't
            search in the message itself.</li>
        <li><code>cat:</code> to specify a category the user who send the message
        should be in (as defined in the <a href="help.html#addressbook">Addressbook</a>).</li>
        <li><code>chan:</code> to specify one or more channels the message has
        to be send in to match (several channels are specified as comma-seperated
        list, without spaces).</li>
        <li><code>!chan:</code> to specify one or more channels the message must
        NOT be send in to match.</li>
        <li><code>color:</code> to specify a color other than the default one
            for displaying this highlight. <em>If you have items with a custom
                color defined, which match something that might also be matched
                by other items (with another color or custom color)
            then the order of items is important so it displays the desired color.
            Items on the top are matched first, so move items up that should take
            precedence. For example <code>test</code> and
            <code>color:blue test2</code>. If <code>test</code> is on the top
            it will never get to the blue one, because <code>test</code> will
            always match when <code>test2</code> would match as well.</em></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Examples</h3>

    </h2>
    <p>Ignores chat messages, either because they match the specified text or -
    using prefix - other properties like which user wrote the message. Ignored
    messages get added to a special dialog that can be opened via <code>View - Ignored</code>.</p>
    <p>The matching of messages works the same as the <a href="#Highlight">Highlights</a>
    system, please see that help for information on that. For quick reference here just a few examples:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><code>user:name</code></dt>
        <dd>Ignores the user with the name <code>name</code> in all channels</dd>
        
        <dt><code>user:name chan:tirean,gocnak</code></dt>
        <dd>Ignores the user with the name <code>name</code> in channels <code>#tirean</code> and <code>#gocnak</code></dd>
        
        <dt><code>cat:ignore !chan:lotsofs,joshimuz</code></dt>
        <dd>Ignores users in the addressbook category <code>ignore</code> in all channels,
            except <code>#lotsofs</code> and <code>#joshimuz</code></dd>

    <h3>General Options</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enable Ignore</strong>: Enable/disable the Ignore System
        altogether</li>
        <li><strong>Ignore own messages</strong>: Also ignore own messages (if
        they match), can be useful for testing</li>
        <li>What should happen with ignored messages:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hide</strong>: Don't show ignored messages in chat
                    at all (they still get added to the <code>Ignored</code> dialog)</li>
                <li><strong>Show count</strong>: Shows the number of ignored messages
                in chat every 30s (if there were any), so you know that messages
                were ignored</li>
                <li><strong>Show names</strong>: Shows the name of the sender of
                any ignored messages, in a list similiar to MOD/UNMOD or JOIN/PART
                messages</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Only show if ignored messages dialog is not open</strong>:
        Only show what is configured for "What should happen with ignored messages"
        when the ignored messages dialog isn't currently open.</li>

        <a name="Sounds">Sounds</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>General Sound Settings</h3>
    <p>You can enable or disable all sounds here. Sounds are searched in the
    displayed folder, which is the current working directory. Any valid sound
    files in the folder should be selectable as a sound to be played. If you
    added or removed files, you may have to use <code>Rescan folder</code> to
    make the files show up in the list. You can open the folder in your standard
    file browser from here to add files to it more quickly.</p>
    
    <h3>Sound Types Settings</h3>
    <p>You can specify requirements, soundfile, volume and delay for three
        different types of events:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When a message is highlighted</li>
        <li>When a stream changes status (online/offline/changed title/changed game)</li>
        <li>When any message in received in any open channel</li>
        <li>When someone joins/leaves any open channel</li>
        <li>When a new follower is detected <em>(this only works if the <a href="help.html#followers">Follower
                    Dialog</a> is currently open)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can set a delay (seconds) so that the same sound won't be played twice during
    the set number of seconds. So if e.g. 3 highlighted messages come in within
    10 seconds and the delay is set to 15 seconds, only one sound will be played.</p>
    
    <p>Each sound has different options for when the sound should be played. See
        the <a href="#Notifications">Notification Settings</a> for help on the options.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Notifications">Notifications</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>Notifications</h3>
    <p>Select when a notification should be shown for either <em>Highlight</em>
        (when a message in chat is highlighted) or <em>Stream Status</em> (when
    Chatty learns of a new stream status, e.g. offline -> online, new game, new
    title etc.).</p>
    
    <p>There are different options for when a notification should be shown:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Off</strong> - Never show</li>
        <li><strong>When channel/app not active</strong> - Only when the channel
        isn't the currently selected tab AND when the program doesn't have focus</li>
        <li><strong>When channel or app not active</strong> - Only when the channel
        isn't the currently selected tab OR when the program doesn't have focus</li>
        <li><strong>When app not active</strong> - Only when the program doesn't
        have focus</li>
        <li><strong>When channel not active</strong> - Only when the channel
        isn't the currently selected tab</li>
        <li><strong>When channel active</strong> - Only when the channel IS the
        currently selected tab</li>
        <li><strong>Always</strong> - No requirements, always show it</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Notification Type / Options</h3>
    <p>Select here whether to use the <em>Chatty Notifications</em> or the default
        <em>System Tray Notifications</em>. This settings DOES NOT enable or
    disable notifications altogether, just switch between the types.</p>
    <p>If you have <em>Chatty Notifications</em> selected, you can change some
    more options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Position:</strong> In which corner the the notification appears on the screen</li>
        <li><strong>Screen:</strong> On which screen the notification appears (<code>auto</code> means
        it's on the same screen as the Chatty window)</li>
        <li><strong>Display Time:</strong> How long the notification will be displayed
        by default. This can vary a bit depending on the situation.</li>
        <li><strong>No User Activity:</strong> This is a tricky one. If you enable
        this, then the notification will not be closed after the defined Display Time
        if no activity was detected in the last few seconds. This can be useful
        to still see notifications from a few minutes ago if you were away from
        the computer.
        The time defines
        when the notification will be closed no
        matter what, so older notifications won't stay there forever if you are
        away from the computer for a bit longer. 
        <br /><br />Activity is tracked through two methods: 
        The first method is tracking the system-wide mouse movements, which is
        done through an API that may not always return accurate information
        (e.g. if you are in a game) and it only checks the position every few
        seconds (only the last location is saved at any time for comparison).
        The second method detects activity only inside of Chatty, by tracking
        button presses and mouse actions (e.g. if you type a message, open a
        dialog etc.).</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Followed Streams</h3>
    <p>Enable this to make Chatty get a list of your followed streams regulary
    so it can display notifications if their status changes. This simpy allows
    Chatty to know about your followed streams, so notifications aren't the only
    advantage. It also allows it to record the viewer count and status history
    of followed live streams as long as Chatty is running.</p>

        <a name="Logging">Logging</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you enable logging, chat messages (and more if enabled) will be written
    into a seperate textfile for each channel.</p>
    <h3>Channels</h3>
    <p>You can specify which channels should be logged:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>always</strong> - Log all channels without exception</li>
        <li><strong>blacklist</strong> - Log all channels, except the ones on
        the blacklist</li>
        <li><strong>whitelist</strong> - Log no channels, except the ones on the
        whitelist</li>
        <li><strong>off</strong> - Log no channels whatsoever</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Messages Types</h3>
    <p>Normal chat messages are always logged, however you can log additional
    information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chat Info</strong> refers to general chat releated info messages
        like connecting/disconnecting/trying to timeout someone/stream title..</li>
        <li><strong>Bans/Timeouts</strong> refers to bans/timeouts in chat, which
            will be logged like this: <code>[12:32:25] BAN: name, name2</code></li>
        <li><strong>Mod/Unmod</strong> refers to when someone in chat is modded/
            unmodded, which will be logged like this: <code>[12:32:25] MOD: name1, name2</code></li>
        <li><strong>Joins/Parts</strong> refers to when someone joins/parts the
        channel, which will be logged like this: <code>[12:32:25] JOIN: name1, name2</code></li>
        <li><strong>System Info</strong> means any info messages that are related
        more to Chatty than chat itself, like info about new versions, if you use
        settings commands..</li>
        <li><strong>Viewerstats</strong> are stats about the viewercount which
        are logged in a semi-regular interval to give some idea about the viewercount
        during that time. It shows which interval it refers to, the min/max/avg viewers,
        the number of values and the development (first value/after offline is absolute, then +-
        relative change, _ means offline before/in between/after that value, e.g.
        <code>[21:06:21] Viewerstats (21:03-21:06): avg:28.612 min:28.432 max:28.887 [3/28.519-87+455_]</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>Viewercount</strong> will log the viewercount as it is updated,
            like this: <code>[15:23:58] VIEWERS: 12521</code></li>
    </ul>

                open dialogs in their default location (centered on the main
                window) when you open them.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep location during session</strong>: Puts dialogs
                at the same position when you reopen them during the same
                session (so they are put on the default location when you open
                them the first time after starting Chatty).</li>
                <li><strong>Restore dialogs from last session</strong>: Puts
                dialogs at the same position they were at when you closed Chatty
                last session and also keeps the position during the session.</li>
                <li><strong>Reopen dialogs from last session</strong>: Reopens

            some occasions, but not for URLs in chat.</li>
        <li><strong>Always show chat scrollbar</strong>: Always show the vertical
        scrollbar in the chat window (there should never be a horizontal one),
        even if no scrolling is necessary. This can be useful for using window
        capture for streaming, because you can always keep the same subregion.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimize to tray</strong>: When minimizing the main Chatty
        window, it will be minimized to tray.</li>
        <li><strong>Close to tray</strong>: Closing the main Chatty window will
        not actually exit the program, but instead minimize it to tray. You can
        actually close the program via <code>Main - Exit</code> or the tray icon
        context menu.</li>
        <li><strong>Tab Order</strong>: Whether to show tabs in the order they

        window that is opened. Each saved location/size is only used once, if
        there is none left then the default attributes are used. This is also
        saved between sessions (attributes of popouts that are open when you
        close Chatty are saved as well).</li>
        <li><strong>Close popout when only channel</strong>: When you have a
        channel popout window open and close the last channel in the main window,
        then the popout window will automatically be closed and the channel
        moved to the main window. Disable this if the popout shouldn't be closed

        <a name="Commands">Commands</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>Custom Commands</h3>
    <p>Custom commands allow you to specify aliases for anything you could also
    enter directly into the inputbox (like chat messages or regular commands),
    with the exception of other custom commands, which is a limitation
    implemented to prevent infinite loops. Custom commands you add should be in
    the following format:</p>
    
    <p><code>/&lt;commandName&gt; &lt;text of the command&gt;</code></p>
    
    <p>Everything until the first space is the name of the comand, and everything
    after the first space is the text of the command. For example:</p>
    
    <p><code>/hello Hello World!</code></p>
    
    <p>If you added that to the custom commands and enter <code>/hello</code>
        in the inputbox, then it would send <code>Hello World!</code>, just as
    if you would have written it yourself and pressed Enter.</p>
    
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>You can also specify parameters in the command text, which will be replaced
    when you execute the custom command. For example:</p>
    <p><code>/permit !permit $$1</code></p>
    <p>When you enter <code>/permit name</code>, then it will replace <code>$$1</code>
        with the first word after the command, which in this case would be
        <code>name</code>, making the actually send text <code>!permit name</code>.</p>
    
    <p>This is the syntax for specifying parameters (word in this context means
    anything seperated by a space):</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><code>$1, $2, $3</code></dt>
        <dd>First word, second word, third word etc.</dd>
        
        <dt><code>$1-</code></dt>
        <dd>First word, and all the words after it</dd>
        <dd>Equivalently <code>$2-, $3-</code> etc.</dd>
        
        <dt><code>$$1</code></dt>
        <dd>First word, but required, meaning the command result will only be
        send if all the required commands are actually there</dd>
        <dd>Equivalently <code>$$2, $$3-</code> is also possible</dd>
        
        <dt><code>\$1-</code></dt>
        <dd>Escape any special character (like <code>$</code>) by prepending a backslash
            <code>\</code>, which means this won't be interpreted as a parameter
        and not be replaced</dd>
        <dd>If you actually want to use <code>\</code>, you can escape the
            backslash itself, for example <code>\\$1-</code> will be replaced
            (leaving one backslash in front of the replaced parameter)</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h3>Menu/Button Commands</h3>
    <p>You can add custom commands amd regular commands to the <code>User Context Menu</code> (when you right-click
        on a user in chat), the <code>Channel Context Menu</code> (when you right-click anywhere on the chat
        that is not otherwise linked) and add custom <code>User Dialog Buttons</code> (alongside
    the timeout buttons).</p>
    <p>Commands can be added in the following format:</p>
    <p><code>/&lt;commandName1&gt;, /&lt;commandName2&gt;</code></p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <p><code>/Slap, /Permit</code></p>
    <p>Which means the command with the name <code>slap</code> will be added
        first, then <code>permit</code> after that. You can use spaces,
        linebreaks and/or commas as seperators between commands.</p>
    
    <p>This is the syntax for specifying commands in the context menus/user info dialog:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><code>/Slap /Permit</code> or <code>Slap, Permit</code> or <code>Slap Permit</code></dt>
        <dd>Commands can be specified with or without forward slash <code>/</code>, then the name
        (without parameters) and space, linebreak or comma to seperate to the next command.</dd>
        <dt><code>//Slap</code></dt>
        <dd>Prepending two forward slashes <code>//</code> will put the command
            in the special submenu <code>More..</code> (for context menus) or
            in a second line of buttons (for the user context menu).</dd>
        <dt><code>| Slap</code> or <code>|//Slap</code></dt>
        <dd>Adding <code>|</code> (vertical bar) will add a seperator before the
            menu item for the next command (does nothing in the user info dialog).
            The <code>|</code> doesn't have to be directly in front of the command,
            it simply applies to the following command.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>Underscores are replaced with a space for display in a
        context menu or on button (e.g. <code>/Set_color</code> would be displayed
        as <code>Set color</code>).</p>
    
    <p>If you click a command in the User Context Menu or the User Info Dialog,
    then that command will be executed, while automatically adding the name of
    the associated user as the first parameter (allowing you to e.g. use a
    command like <code>/permit !permit $$1</code> with the user you opened the
    context menu on by just adding <code>/Permit</code> to the menu).
    The Channel Context Menu does
    not provide a parameter. There is however always the implicit channel
    parameter, which means commands will be executed on the appropriate channel
    (just as if you entered the command in the channel's inputbox).</p>
    
    <p>The User Dialog Buttons setting is sepecial in that you can also define
        <strong>Timeout buttons</strong> there. Times are comma-seperated and interpreted as
        seconds by default, but you can add suffixes to change that (s - seconds,
        m - minutes, h - hours, d - days). Without a suffix, the button label is
        automatically made, with a suffix that text is used (for example <code>120</code>
        creates a button with a 120s timeout, with a label of "2m", <code>120s</code>
        creates the same button, but with a label of "120s").</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Other">Other</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scroll down after [..] seconds of inactivity</strong>: If you scrolled
        up in chat but haven't moved scrollposition in the given number of seconds, it will scroll down
        if new messages come in. This prevents accidently scrolling up from hiding
        new messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat buffer size</strong>: How many lines of text are kept
        for each channel in chat to scroll back to.</li>
        <li><strong>Inform me about new versions</strong>: Checks for new
        versions every few days and outputs a message about it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Write Stream Status</h3>
    <p>You can let Chatty write information (title, game, viewercount) of a
        certain stream to a file. The file will be written to the subfolder <code>exported</code> of the settings directory
    (enter <code>/dir</code> to find out where that is). Stream information is
    only written if Chatty gets that data, so for it to work properly you need
    to currently have the channel of that stream open in Chatty. (When you change
    the setting, data will be requested once for testing, but you have to be in
    the channel for it to be updated regulary.)</p>
    
    <p>To save stream information to a file, you have to define it in the
    setting. Each line represents one stream/file and the content to write into
    the file. The format for each line is:</p>
    
    <p style="padding-left:10px;"><code>&lt;streamname&gt; &lt;filename&gt; [online/offline] &lt;content&gt;</code></p>
    
    <p>The optional parameter <code>online/offline</code> defines whether to
    write the given content to the file when the stream is online or offline. So
    you could for example define one line for online, which writes the viewercount
    and another for offline which writes "Offline" or maybe no content at all, which clears the file.
    If you only define one for online, then
    the file is not written if the stream is offline, so the previous info will
    stay in there. If you ommit this parameter, then online is assumed.</p>
    
    <p>The following codes in the content will be replaced with the appropriate data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>%title</code> - The title of the stream</li>
        <li><code>%game</code> - The game of the stream</li>
        <li><code>%viewers</code> - The current viewercount</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example which will write two files (if joined to #joshimuz):</p>
    <p style="padding-left:10px;">
    <code>

    <p>If the stream is online, it writes the title and viewercount to <code>title.txt</code>
        and the game to <code>game.txt</code>.
    If the stream is offline it writes "Stream offline" to <code>title.txt</code> and empties
    <code>game.txt</code>.</p>

    <p>These settings should only be changed if you know what you're doing. You
    can however reset any setting to the default by either deleting the settings
    file or using <a href="help.html#settings">setting commands</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Connecting</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Server</strong>: The default server to connect to</li>
        <li><strong>Port</strong>: The default port(s) to connect to (can be
            a list of ports, e.g. <code>6667,80</code>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The values of these settings are used when connecting, unless the commandline
        parameters <code>-server</code> and/or <code>-port</code> are used,
    then the value that is given there is used instead (without it being shown
    here). You should know if you set a server or port with a commandline
    parameter, but you can also check that by using <code>/get server</code>
    and <code>/get port</code>.</p>

    <h3><a name="Advanced-TC">Twitch Client Version</a></h3>
    
    <p>The Twitch Client Version is a sort of setting of Twitch Chat that
        affects how it behaves (what kind of messages it sends in addition to
        normal chat messages). Version 3 has been added with the introduction
        of Group Chat (at the same time the subscriber notification
        - <code>&lt;name&gt; just subscribed</code> - had been removed from other
        versions, but was re-added again a few months later).
        See the table below for a full comparison.</p>
    <p>tl;dr It probably makes sense to use Version 3 if you don't care about:
            joins/parts, a correct userlist or a correct usercount.</p>
    
    <p><em>Requires you to reconnect for all changes to take effect,
                because the Chat Version is set when you connect.</em></p>

                The userlist will only contain users who have said something and

                The usercount (number on the left in the title) is based on the
                userlist, so it won't be correct either (viewercount is unaffected).
